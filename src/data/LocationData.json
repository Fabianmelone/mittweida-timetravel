      "A competition to realize a central city library brought the idea of doing something new with the building back to life. Out of ten concepts that were submitted, one was declared as the winner on December 7th 2018, which was the 'Raum und Bau GmbH, Dresden'. Unfortunately, a lot of the pieces of the old building were to fragile, but the architects managed to integrate some of the old parts in the new building to keep its identity alive. The rebuild of the city library costed around 6,7 million and was a part of a project for the integrated development of the city district between 'Schwanenteich bis Goethehain', which was financed by the operational program of the free state Saxony for the european fond for regional development (EFRE) from 2014 to 2020 which financially supported the project by 80%",
      "The three-story building used to be the cultural center of the city and was used as a ballroom and later as a cinema. After the German reunition the building stood empty, from 1993. Later, around 2013 the city bought the building back from private ownership, but they had to stop using the rooms, because of danger of collapse."]
